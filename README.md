# Car Management Backend API

This project provides a RESTful backend API for managing car information, including user authentication and image uploads.  It uses Express.js, Mongoose (for MongoDB), Cloudinary for image storage, and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newideas-code/car-managment-backend.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd car-managment-backend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
   - `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string (e.g., `mongodb://localhost:27017/car_database`).
   - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`: Your Cloudinary cloud name.
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`: Your Cloudinary API key.
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`: Your Cloudinary API secret.
   - `PORT`: The port the server should listen on (default is 5000).

5. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```


## Usage Guide

This backend API uses standard RESTful principles.  Authentication is required for most endpoints using JWTs.  You'll need to obtain a JWT by making a POST request to the `/auth/login` or `/auth/register` endpoints (see API documentation below).  Include the JWT in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>`).  Use a tool like Postman or curl to interact with the API.


## API Documentation

*(Note:  The provided code lacks detailed API endpoint specifications. The following is a placeholder.  You should replace this section with actual API documentation for each endpoint, including request methods, parameters, request body examples, response codes, and response body examples.)*


**Authentication:**

* `/auth/register`: POST - Registers a new user.  Requires a JSON body with username and password.
* `/auth/login`: POST - Logs in an existing user.  Requires a JSON body with username and password.  Returns a JWT upon successful login.

**Car Management:**

* `/cars`:  GET - Retrieves all cars. (Requires authentication)
* `/cars`: POST - Creates a new car. (Requires authentication)  Requires a JSON body with car details (make, model, etc.).
* `/cars/:id`: GET - Retrieves a specific car by ID. (Requires authentication)
* `/cars/:id`: PUT - Updates a specific car by ID. (Requires authentication) Requires a JSON body with updated car details.
* `/cars/:id`: DELETE - Deletes a specific car by ID. (Requires authentication)



## Code Snippets

**`cloudinary.js` (Cloudinary Image Upload):**

This function handles uploading images to Cloudinary.  It returns the secure URL and public ID of the uploaded image.

```javascript
exports.uploads = async (file, folder) => {
    try {
        const result = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(file, {
            resource_type: "auto",
            folder: folder
        });
        return {
            url: result.secure_url,  // Use secure_url for HTTPS links
            id: result.public_id
        };
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Cloudinary Upload Error:", error.message);
        throw new Error("Failed to upload to Cloudinary");
    }
};
```

**`db.js` (MongoDB Connection):**

This function establishes a connection to the MongoDB database using the URI specified in the environment variables.

```javascript
const connectDB = async () => {
    try {
        await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {
            useNewUrlParser: true,
            useUnifiedTopology: true,
        });
        console.log("MongoDB connected");
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("MongoDB connection error:", error);
        process.exit(1);
    }
};
```
