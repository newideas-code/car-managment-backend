# Car Management Backend

This project provides a backend API for managing car information.  It utilizes Express.js, Mongoose (for MongoDB interaction), Cloudinary for image storage, and JSON Web Tokens for authentication.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newideas-code/car-managment-backend.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd car-managment-backend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
   - `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
   - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`: Your Cloudinary cloud name.
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`: Your Cloudinary API key.
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`: Your Cloudinary API secret.
   - `PORT`: The port the server should listen on (default is 5000).


5. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```


## Usage Guide

This backend API provides endpoints for car management.  The specific endpoints and their functionalities are defined in `authRoutes.js` and `carRoutes.js`.  You will need to use a tool like Postman or curl to interact with these endpoints.  Authentication is likely handled through JWTs, requiring appropriate tokens for protected routes.  More detailed documentation on the API endpoints would be beneficial to include here.  For example:

**Example (Illustrative - replace with actual endpoints):**

```bash
# POST request to create a new car (requires authentication)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>" -d '{"make": "Toyota", "model": "Camry"}' http://localhost:5000/cars
```


## Code Snippets

**`cloudinary.js` (Cloudinary Image Upload):**

This code handles uploading images to Cloudinary.

```javascript
exports.uploads = async (file, folder) => {
    try {
        const result = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(file, {
            resource_type: "auto",
            folder: folder
        });
        return {
            url: result.secure_url,  // Use secure_url for HTTPS links
            id: result.public_id
        };
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Cloudinary Upload Error:", error.message);
        throw new Error("Failed to upload to Cloudinary");
    }
};
```

**`db.js` (MongoDB Connection):**

This code establishes a connection to the MongoDB database.

```javascript
const connectDB = async () => {
    try {
        await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {
            useNewUrlParser: true,
            useUnifiedTopology: true,
        });
        console.log("MongoDB connected");
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("MongoDB connection error:", error);
        process.exit(1);
    }
};
```
